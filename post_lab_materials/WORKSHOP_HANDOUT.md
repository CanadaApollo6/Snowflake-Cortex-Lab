## üí° Quick Reference: Cortex Functions

### Sentiment Analysis

```sql
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(text_column) AS sentiment
FROM your_table;
-- Returns: -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive)
```

### Translation

```sql
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE(
  text_column,
  'source_language',  -- e.g., 'es' for Spanish
  'target_language'   -- e.g., 'en' for English
) AS translated_text
FROM your_table;
```

### Summarization

```sql
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(long_text_column) AS summary
FROM your_table;
```

### LLM Completion

```sql
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
  'mixtral-8x7b',  -- Model name
  'Your prompt here: ' || text_column
) AS llm_response
FROM your_table;
```

### Semantic Search

```sql
-- First, create a search service (one-time setup)
CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE my_search
ON text_column
ATTRIBUTES category, date
WAREHOUSE = my_warehouse
TARGET_LAG = '1 minute'
AS (SELECT * FROM my_table);

-- Then search with natural language
SELECT *
FROM TABLE(my_search!SEARCH('your natural language query'))
LIMIT 5;
```

### RAG Pattern (Search + LLM)

```sql
WITH search_results AS (
  SELECT content
  FROM TABLE(my_search!SEARCH('user question'))
  LIMIT 3
)
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
  'mixtral-8x7b',
  'Answer this question using only the provided docs:

  Question: [user question]

  Documentation: ' || LISTAGG(content, '\n') || '

  Answer:'
) AS accurate_answer
FROM search_results;
```
