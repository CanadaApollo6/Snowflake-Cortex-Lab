- 🎯 **Sentiment Analysis** - Automatically detect customer emotions in support tickets
- 🌍 **Multi-language Translation** - Break down language barriers in global data
- 📝 **Text Summarization** - Condense lengthy documents into key insights
- 🤖 **LLM Integration** - Use large language models for classification, extraction, and generation
- 🔍 **Semantic Search** - Find documents by meaning, not just keywords
- 💡 **RAG Patterns** - Build accurate, grounded AI applications that prevent hallucination

| **Sales Transcripts** | 4+ | Realistic sales call conversations | Extraction, summarization, analysis |

**Languages Supported:** English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese

## Workshop Exercises

### Worksheet 1: Foundation - Cortex LLM Functions (15 min)

Learn the building blocks of Cortex AI:

- Analyze customer sentiment to prioritize urgent issues
- Translate multi-language tickets for global support teams
- Summarize lengthy documentation for quick reference
- Combine multiple Cortex functions in sophisticated workflows

**Key Query Example:**

```sql
-- Translate non-English tickets and analyze sentiment
SELECT
  ticket_id,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE(subject, language, 'en') AS english_subject,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(description) AS sentiment_score
FROM CUSTOMER_SUPPORT_TICKETS
WHERE language != 'en';
```

### Worksheet 2: Power - Cortex Complete (12 min)

Harness the full power of large language models:

- Automatically classify support tickets into categories
- Extract structured data from unstructured text
- Generate personalized responses to customer reviews
- Compare different LLM models for your use case
- Build an automated ticket triage system

**Key Query Example:**

```sql
-- Classify support tickets using LLM
SELECT
  ticket_id,
  subject,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
    'mixtral-8x7b',
    'Categorize this ticket (one word): shipping, product_quality, payment, or technical.

    Ticket: ' || subject || '

    Category:'
  ) AS ticket_category
FROM CUSTOMER_SUPPORT_TICKETS;
```

### Worksheet 3: Advanced - Cortex Search & RAG (15 min)

Build intelligent search and Q&A systems:

- Create semantic search services on documentation
- Search by meaning, not just keywords
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns
- Build a knowledge base chatbot
- Auto-generate support responses from documentation

**Key Query Example:**

```sql
-- RAG: Search docs + LLM for accurate answers
WITH search_results AS (
  SELECT content
  FROM TABLE(PRODUCT_DOCS_SEARCH!SEARCH('How do I pair the headphones?'))
  LIMIT 3
)
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
  'mixtral-8x7b',
  'Answer this question using ONLY the provided documentation:

  Question: How do I pair the UltraSound Pro headphones?

  Documentation: ' || LISTAGG(content, '\n') || '

  Answer:'
) AS ai_answer
FROM search_results;
```

## Post-Workshop Cleanup

After the workshop concludes (typically 7-14 days later):

```sql
-- Run as ACCOUNTADMIN
@lab_setup/account-cleanup.sql
```

This removes all lab accounts, workspaces, and optionally the sample data to clean up your Snowflake environment.
